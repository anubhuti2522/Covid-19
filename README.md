Used Tableau to perform calculation for Data Visualization of Covid-19 in India.

For the data Visualization of Day Wise Drift of Covid-19 cases in India.Drag and drop the fields on the specified position to get the visualization. Add "Date" to "pages" to show a drift in each day. The increase in the size of bubble shows the intensity with which the virus is spreading in that region.

This comparision shows the Butterfly chart of the number of cases which are cured and the number of deaths in India. THe chart is organised in the decreasing of the severeness of virus in that state. This charts helps to analyse the speed with which the virus is spreading day by day and is killing thousands of people daily.
